          Envx is a tool I wrote that allows you to share and synchronize
          environment variables between you and your team. It uses RSA4096
          encryption to encrypt the environment variables for each member of the
          team, and decrypts them on the client side on request. The server
          stores all of the public keys, along with a UUID, and not much else.
